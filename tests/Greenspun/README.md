# Greenspun test

We try to have a *small* program to test the Greenspun interpreter; for this purpose
we have a Makefile that compiles velocypack (plus XXH64 hash, because reasons), and
the Greenspun interpreter.

Feel free to fix this, but *do not* build a whole arangod for every build of this 
test program.
